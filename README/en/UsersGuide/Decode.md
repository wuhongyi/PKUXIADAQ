# Decode

**The Decode program is used to convert data collected by different capture cards in the same run into a ROOT file. The user's physical analysis is based on the ROOT file generated by the program.**


The user first needs to modify the definition in the **UesrDefine.hh** file.  


```cpp
#define ROOTFILEPATH "/home/wuhongyi/data/"  //The path to generate the ROOT file
#define RAWFILEPATH "/home/wuhongyi/data/"   //The path of the original binary
#define RAWFILENAME "data"                   //The filename of the original binary


#define Crate0
#define Crate0num 5   //Number of plugins used in this chassis
const int Crate0SamplingRate[Crate0num] = {100,100,100,250,250};//Specify the sampling rate for each plugin separately, 100/250/500 three sampling rates, 0 means skipping the plugin.
```

Users need to modify the following concents:
   -  The directory where the original binary files are stored.
   -  The directory where the generated ROOT files are stored.
   - File name.
   - Number of capture cards used in the chassis.
   - The sampling frequency corresponding to each acquisition card. If the sampling frequency is set to 0, the data of the acquisition card is ignored.


After modifying, execute the following command to compile the program:  

```bash
make clean
make
```

After the compilation is successful, an executable file **decode** will be generated, and the program will run as follows:  


```bash
./decode [RuNnumber]
```

**[RuNnumber]** is the file run number you want to convert.  


For example: 
```bash
./decade  3
```

**ROOT File Branch：**

- sr(short): sample rate，100/250/500，This value is specified in UesrDefine.hh.
- pileup(bool): pile-up flag
- outofr(bool): the overrange flag
- cid(short): chassis number
- sid(short): slot number
- ch(short): channel number
- evte(unsigned short): energy
- ts(long int 64 bit): timestamps
- ets(long int 64 bit): external timestamps
- cfd(short): cfd value
- cfdft(bool): Is the cfd value valid? yes or no
- cfds(short):cfd source，only for 250/500 MHz modules
- trae(unsigned int): energy trapezoidal rising segment integral 
- leae(unsigned int): energy trapezoidal falling segment integral 
- gape(unsigned int): energy trapezoidal gaps segment integral 
- base(double):the baseline of the energy trapezoidal algorithm
- qs(unsigned int): the integral of eight QDC areas
- ltra(unsigned short): umber of waveform acquisition points
- data(unsigned short): waveform data
- dt(unsigned short): In order to view each waveform directly, an array of values from 0 - N-1 is added 
- nevt(unsigned int): the number of this event in this ROOT file 

The following figure shows the Branch definition in a file:

----

At the end of each run of data conversion, a **txt** file will be generated in this folder, which counts the following information for each channel of the modules:
- Mod: Module number, starting from 0.
- Channel: Channel marker, 0 - 15.
- OutOfRange: Number of events whose signal amplitude exceeds the range of the analog-to-digital conversion module.
- Pileup: Number of events marked as pile-up.
- CfdForcedTrigger: Number of events forced by cfd (cfd does not exceeded threshold).
- Energy->0: Calculate the number of events with trapezoidal energy less than 0 (the result is less than 0 and is directly marked as 0).
- WaveformCount: Number of events recording the waveform.
- TotalEvent: Total number of output events.
