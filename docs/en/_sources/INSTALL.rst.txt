=================================   
Installation of Software
=================================   


Installation for this software is requrired by

- CERN ROOT 6
	- GCC >= 4.8
- FFTW3

The operating system tested by this program includes CentOS7 / Scientific Linux 7 / Ubuntu18.04

**This package uses PLX9054 driver with version 8.23. The operating systems supported by this version of the driver are CentOS 7 / CentOS 8 / Debian 08 / Debian 09 / Debian 10 / Ubuntu 18.04.**

.. DANGER::
   Graphical interface programs and non-graphical interface programs cannot run at the same time!
   
   Graphical interface programs and non-graphical interface programs cannot run at the same time!

   Graphical interface programs and non-graphical interface programs cannot run at the same time!

---------------------------------
The steps for Installation
---------------------------------

- Delete the old version of the PKUXIADAQ folder in your personal directory
- Extract this package into your personal directory ($HOME)
- Set up environment variables
- Compile Plx9054 driver
- Compile pixie16 driver API (this API has been modified by Hongyi Wu, driven by unofficial standards)
- Compile graphical acquisition software
- Compile non-graphical acquisition software
- Compile online monitor program
- Compile data converter program
- Compile event reconstruction program (optional)


.. code:: bash
	  
  ## Set up environment variables
   
   
  # Add the follwing content into .bashrc file
  export PLX_SDK_DIR=$HOME/PKUXIADAQ/PlxSdk
   
  # put PKUXIADAQ.tar.gz(or PKUXIADAQ-master.tar.gz) in the personal directory /home, the position ~/ 
   
  tar -zxvf PKUXIADAQ.tar.gz  
  or 
  tar -zxvf PKUXIADAQ-master.tar.gz
  mv PKUXIADAQ-master  PKUXIADAQ
   
  # Acquire PKUXIADAQ directory

  
.. code:: bash
	  
  ## Compile Plx9054 driver
   
  # Open a new terminal
  cd ~
  cd PKUXIADAQ/
  #Delete the undeleted driver that may exist. If there is no such directory, you do not need to execute the command.
  rm -rf PlxSdk
  tar -xvf PlxSdk823.tar
  cd PlxSdk/PlxApi/

  # If it succeeds,you will see Library "Library/PlxApi.a" built successfully

.. code:: bash

  ## Compile pixie16
   
  cd ~
  cd PKUXIADAQ/software/
  make clean
  make 
   
  # As long as no error is reported, the libPixie16App.a libPixie16Sys.a will be generated in the folder 

  

.. code:: bash

  # Modify settings parameters
  cd ~
  cd PKUXIADAQ/parset/
   
   
  # Modify cfgPixie16.txt file。
  # The value after CrateID indicates the chassis number, and the value is allowed to be 0-15. If there is only a chassis, the parameter is set freely (usually the default 0 is used). If multiple chassis are running synchronously, make sure that the number of each chassis is set to a different value.
  # SettingPars Following is the parameter setting file and write the parameter configuration file to be used.
  # ModuleSlot The first value number indicates the number of plugins, and if there are 3 plugins, it is 3. The following numbers are for each plug-in in the slot position of the chassis (the slot position is counted from 2), and there are three plugins followed by 2 3 4 respectively.
  #AutoRunModeTimes The following values are the time for automatic switching in automatic operation mode.
  # Parameter ModuleSampingRate and ModuleBits only take effect in offline mode. When the main interface is initialized in Offline mode, this parameter is read.
   
   
  # Modify the Run.config file, the first line in the file is the original data storage path, and the second is the file name.
  # Modify the RunNumber file, the value in this file is the run number of the actual run.

---------------------------------
Instruction for use
---------------------------------

-  Restart the computer after booting the chassis (the computer must be open later than the chassis)
-  Load Plx9054 driver under ROOT permission after opening the chassis
-  Normal acquisition
   

.. code:: bash

  ## Load Plx9054 driver under ROOT permission
   
   
  cd ~
  cd PKUXIADAQ/PlxSdk/Bin/
  
  ## CENTOS
  su # input ROOT password   
  ./Plx_load 9054
  ## Ubuntu
  ## The 18th line of the file Plx_load needs to be modified:  export PLX_SDK_DIR=$HOME/PKUXIADAQ/PlxSdk
  sudo ./Plx_load 9054
  
  # You Will see a prompt to load successfully
  exit  #Exit ROOT permission  退出ROOT权限
	  


.. code:: bash

  ## Start the graphical interface program
   
  cd ~
  cd ~/PKUXIADAQ/GUI
  ./pku
   
  # The graphical interface will pop up.
  # You can choose Online/Offline Mode then press Boot to initialize.
  # After waiting for initialization, you can modify the output data file path, file name, and run number. Press the Complete button to confirm.
  # The LSRunStart button becomes operational at this time. You can start pressing Start and then press Stop for the second time.
  # Online Statistics option selections mean sending online statistics
  # Update Energy Monitor: Each time you select it, the energy spectrum information is read from the plug-in and sent to the online program (frequent select

	  
.. code:: bash

  ## Start the non-graphical interface program
   
  cd ~
  cd ~/PKUXIADAQ/NOGUI
  ./pku
	  

	  
.. code:: bash

  ## Start online monitor program
   
   
  cd ~
  cd PKUXIADAQ/OnlineStattics/
  ./online
   
  # The graphical interface will pop up.
  # Press RunStart to start monitoring and update the input rate and output rate of each channel every 3 seconds. (The first time you enable the program after opening the chassis, you need to enable it after the acquisition is turned on)
  # In the lower right corner of the monitoring interface, there is monitoring of the amount of hard disk usage for writing data.
   
   
   
  # EnergyMonitor page is used to view the spectrum. Due to the internal register size limitations of the plug-in, this energy spectrum differs from the actual spectrum in channel range.

  
.. code:: bash	  

  ## execute data converter program
   
   
  cd ~
  cd PKUXIADAQ/Decode/
   
  # After the last run of acquisition, we can convert the previous run of data to ROOT file.
   
  ./decode xxx
  #xxx indicates Run Number


---------------------------------
Common installation errors
---------------------------------

For CentOS / scientific Linux 7.6 / 7.7, the wrong solution for installing PLX9054 driver:

.. code:: bash
	  
  ./builddriver 9054


.. code:: bash	

  Build: Plx9054
   
  - PLA: CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core) 
  - KER: 3.10.0-957.12.2.el7.x86_64
  - INC: /lib/modules/3.10.0-957.12.2.el7.x86_64/build/include
  - CPU: x86_64 (64-bit Little Endian)
  - CMP: Gcc
  - TYP: Driver
  - PLX: 9054
  - CFG: Release
   
  make[1]: Entering directory '/usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-957.12.2.el7.x86_64'
  arch/x86/Makefile:166: *** CONFIG_RETPOLINE=y, but not supported by the compiler. Compiler update recommended.。 Stop.
  make[1]: Leaving directory '/usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-957.12.2.el7.x86_64'
  make: *** [BuildDriver] Error 2

The above is the output prompt when the error occurs.

At this point, the user can modify the file **/usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-957.12.2.el7.x86_64/arch/x86/Makefile** to avoid this error by cancel the following code.

.. code:: bash	

    ifneq ($(RETPOLINE_CFLAGS),)
        KBUILD_CFLAGS += $(RETPOLINE_CFLAGS) -DRETPOLINE
    else
        $(error CONFIG_RETPOLINE=y, but not supported by the compiler. Compiler update recommended.)
    endif
