 * most prominent tasks are those to set the DACs and program the trigger/filter
 * FPGAs. The following is a list of control tasks that will be of interest to
 * the programmer.

 * To start a control task, set RUNTASK=0 and choose a CONTROLTASK value from
 * the list below. Then start a run by setting bit 0 in the control and status
 * register (CSR).
 *
 * Control tasks respond within a few hundred nanoseconds by setting the
 * RUNACTIVE bit (#13) in the CSR. The host can poll the CSR and watch for the
 * RUNACTIVE bit to be deasserted. All control tasks indicate task completion
 * by clearing this bit.
 *
 * Execution times vary considerably from task to task, ranging from under a
 * microsecond to 10 seconds. Hence, polling the CSR is the most effective way
 * to check for completion of a control task.
